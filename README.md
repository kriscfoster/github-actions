[Instructions]: # (To submit to the GitHub Actions x DEV Hackathon 2021, please fill out all sections.)

![GitHub Celebration IOT Workflow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17026751/144413207-cf86613a-18c9-439b-a09b-a8a4e6359042.png)

### My Workflow

Pull requests deserve to be celebrated ðŸŽ‰! This workflow integrates with smart devices to celebrate when a pull request is created. This introduces some fun into the process & could help with team morale. The celebration includes the following:

1. Turn on ðŸŸ¢ **smart bulb**.
2. Play celebration music ðŸŽµ on **smart speaker**.
3. Wait 10 seconds to **enjoy the music** ðŸ•º.
4. Send request to **Raspberry Pi** ðŸ¥§ to take a celebration photo.

    a. Raspberry Pi **takes the photo** ðŸ“¸.

    b. Raspberry Pi **uploads the photo** to cloud storage.

5. **Post message** with the celebration picture to the pull request ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰.

#### How was this Made?

I already had some smart devices so decided to use whatever I already had for the workflow.

##### Turning on Green Light ðŸŸ¢

I used a combination of a green bulb & a TP-Link smart plug for this. The TP-Link plug can be turned on/off using their API but I decided to wrap this functionality into an action that could be used by my workflow & utilized by other workflows in the future. I created this under [tplink-action](https://github.com/kriscfoster/tplink-action).

##### Playing Music on Smart Speaker ðŸŽµ

I used the spotify API directly for this component. Once authenticated, you can use the spotify API to play songs/playlists on a device associated with your account. I have a smart speaker that is connected to spotify so I just needed to make an API call to play celebration music on this speaker.

##### Taking & Uploading Photo with Raspberry Pi ðŸ¥§

This was probably the most complicated part of the project. I built & expose an API from my Raspberry Pi. The code for this API is [here](https://github.com/kriscfoster/pr-celebration-github-workflow/tree/main/rpi-automation). When a request is made to an endpoint on this API, it takes a photo with a camera module on the Raspberry Pi & then uploads the photo to cloud storage. The API response contains the identifier of the photo in storage so the workflow knows how to use it.

##### Posting Photo as Comment on Pull Request ðŸŽ‰

I use the `octokit/request-action` action to post the photo from cloud storage to the pull request.
